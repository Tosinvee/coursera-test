				<h3>POUNDED YAM</h3>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Pounded yam, a classic Nigerian dish, is a smooth and stretchy dough made from boiled yams.
					   It holds an esteemed place in Nigerian cuisine, particularly among the Yoruba people,
					   and is often served during special occasions, family gatherings, and cultural events. 
					   Pounded yam’s rich texture and unique preparation methods make it a beloved food that
					   showcases the versatility and culinary heritage of Nigeria.
					   Pounded is quite similar to mashed potatoes but it has a more doughy consistency.
					   It belongs to a group of food we refer to as swallow because of the way we eat it.
					   We cut out a morsel from the meal,  then we form an indentation on it with the thumb.
					   Then, we scoop some stew or soup over it and we eat it.
					   Often time it’s swallowed, but sometimes it requires a bit of chewing
					   depending on the type of stew or soup you choose to pair it with.
